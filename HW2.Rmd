Visit the website https://covid19.saglik.gov.tr/ which gives official statistics on Covid-19 in
our country. The front web page involves two maps titled "İllere göre haftalık vaka sayısı (100 binde)", and "İllere göre risk durumu", which are given below, respectively.


```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center', out.width="60%", fig.cap = "İllere göre haftalık vaka sayısı (100 binde)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/illere_gore_vaka.png")
```


```{r, echo=F, fig.align='center', out.width="60%", fig.cap ="İllere göre risk durumu"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/illere_gore_risk.png")
```

1. Scrape the data on "weekly confirmed cases" table available at https://covid19.saglik.gov.tr/  
via `R package rvest`.
2. Use this data to reproduce the identical of these two maps via `R package leaflet` (You can use the `shape files` which we have used in lectures).
3. Feel free to improve the readability of the maps.
4. Since the websites are being upgraded regularly, it is not of importance which data you have used in your homework as long
as it belongs a recent date such as May, June.
5. Furthermore, scrape the data on "Population by Provinces in Turkey" table available at https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCfusuna_g%C3%B6re_T%C3%BCrkiye%27nin_illeri via `R package rvest`.
6. Use the data above to produce a map which displays weekly confirmed cases per population for each province via `R package leaflet`.   

**A side note: You will return three maps in total.**

**Cautionary notes**: 
1) Homework assignments are individual-based studies. For that reason, students are expected to do homework assignments by themselves (**I will also check your commit history to see the evolution of the homework over time**). Homework assignments will not be accepted after deadline. There is **NO** make-up for missed homework.
2) You should download `R Project` on `GitHub` to your local computer, do the changes as needed, delete all the files you have not used to produce your homework, then render the **`.Rmd`** file to **`.html`** file and finally commit and push all the required files (including `.Rmd` files) by
 **June 7, 2021 18:00** via [GitHub Classroom of MAT381E organization](https://github.com/MAT381E).
